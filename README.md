This is a node file that uses inquierer to write a professional readMe.md file

There are two seperate files one that generates the markdowna nd one that runs the main program. While creating this
application i learned more about node and inquierer and how to write files usiing these tools. I also learned
more about how to make a proper readMe file and about licenses.
